Welcome to the Social40 repository!

## What is Social40?
Social40 is a one-stop social portal for 40 SAR’s administrative needs. A problem noticed among many commanders is indeed the backend administrative hassle, such as the manual tracking of activities, participations, statuses, etc.

This core idea was the birth of Social40. Aimed to reduce countless manhours and manual tracking, Social40 handles all this under the hood, paired with a seamless user experience.

Whether you are a commander or a soldier, Social40 can help you visualize and monitor statistics much easier.
